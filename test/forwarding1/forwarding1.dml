# This network consists of 32 autonomous systems, each represented by
# a single router with a single host attached.  (This is so inter-
# domain routing can be tested without the need for intra-domain
# routing.)  It was built with a hierarchical layout, and then a
# couple of additional links were added to make it more interesting.
# In the center is a backbone network consisting of five autonomous
# systems.  Three of those ASes have other ASes connected below them
# in the hierarchy, and it continues in this fashion a few more layers
# down to leaf ASes.
